Trabajamos en remoto desde distintas partes del país, pero fomentamos mucho nuestra cultura, desde nuestras dailies (con“ruinas” incluidas), nuestros random coffees, charlas, formaciones, eventos en persona y mejor no hablamos de nuestros canales de discord…

1er mes | Onboarding

Nos sentaremos contigo para explicarte el negocio, presentarte al equipo, mostrarte cómo trabajamos, las herramientas qué utilizamos y ofrecerte todo lo que necesites en los primeros días de tu incorporación.

Nuestro equipo de tecnología te enseñará nuestro stack, conocerás a todos los miembros del equipo, todo el contexto necesario para entender el proyecto y el entorno en el que trabajarás.

Seguramente entres a mitad de algún sprint. Arrancamos todos los días con una daily muy distendida de compañía a las 10am, para contar brevemente cómo avanzamos cada uno en nuestros proyectos, y posteriormente cada equipo asiste a sus dailies propias.

En este primer mes tanto tus compañeros de desarrollo como nuestros project managers te acompañarán y darán soporte con todo lo que necesites para el proyecto en el que vayas a trabajar.

Nos comunicamos principalmente por Discord, documentamos en Drive y Notion y utilizamos meets para las reuniones. También solemos trabajar con Monday, Trello y Jira, en función del proyecto.

Durante los siguientes meses

A medida que te vayas familiarizando con el proyecto, el equipo y el stack, podrás ayudar a estimar las tareas y desarrollos que nos ayuden a priorizar el backlog proyecto.

Parte de los sprints contendrán trabajos de mejora para optimizar el rendimiento, refactorizar, eliminar legacy, evitar cuellos de botella y en definitiva mejorar la escalabilidad a futuro.

Fomentamos activamente que nuestros compañer@s aporten propuestas y que si tienen una idea la compartan sin miedo, ya sean mejoras para desarrollos existentes, como nuevas funcionalidades que puedan impactar de forma positiva en los proyectos en los que trabajarás.

Como comentábamos más arriba, valoramos la capacidad de trabajar en equipo, la buena comunicación, la calidad del software y las buenas prácticas.

En Secture no paramos de crecer, por lo tanto, queremos que te conviertas en un pilar del equipo y nos ayudes a seguir construyendo nuestros proyectos, equipo y cultura.
