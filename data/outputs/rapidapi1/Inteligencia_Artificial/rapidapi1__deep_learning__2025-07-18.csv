Description

About the NASA Postdoctoral Program

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) offers unique research opportunities to highly-talented scientists to engage in ongoing NASA research projects at a NASA Center, NASA Headquarters, or at a NASA-affiliated research institute. These one- to three-year fellowships are competitive and are designed to advance NASA’s missions in space science, Earth science, aeronautics, space operations, exploration systems, and astrobiology.

Description:

Heliophysics has a vast wealth of data, sampling a wide range of domains, such as the solar interior, corona, heliosphere, magnetosphere, ionosphere, upper atmosphere. There are diverse data sets and models representing many properties (e.g. intensity, magnetic field, current, density, velocity, temperature). These data sets are used to study physical processes and relationships (such as turbulence, waves, shocks, magnetic reconnection) which vary over a wide range of temporal and spatial scales. Because of this, there are many associated challenges facing data science in heliophysics. Modern methods in data science have the potential to access new, exciting results that eluded classical analysis approaches. Machine learning has been shown to improve performance in several elements of space weather forecasting. However, a deep comprehension of machine learning techniques in the context of the heliophysics data environment will open new opportunities for cross-disciplinary sharing and cooperation. More deliberate approaches can help reveal the fundamental physical processes that govern heliophysical systems, and adaptation of methods to specifically target the underlying physics can help turn an improved correlation or forecast into deeper physical insight and understanding.

This opportunity emphasizes the use of machine learning, AI, and advanced mathematical methods to expand the discovery potential of heliophysics mission data, theoretical models, and simulations. Examples include deep learning, neural networks, data segmentation, high dimensionality, and advanced statistical/probabilistic methods.
