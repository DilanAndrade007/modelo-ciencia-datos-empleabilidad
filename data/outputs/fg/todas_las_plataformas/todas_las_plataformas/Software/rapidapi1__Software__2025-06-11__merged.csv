The right fit is a Python expert who has built test automation frameworks for the purpose of testing mobile wireless scenarios such as cellular protocols. So this person is a developer. Also, she/he will then run manual tests, then automate those tests.

Located in the northern Virginia, Washington, DC metro area, my client is a startup with patented communications technology that enables text messaging anywhere in the world with direct satellite to mobile device communications which does not require special dedicated receivers to operate, just your standard mobile device. They have series A funding and will soon be going out for series B.

In this position you will be responsible for designing, building, integrating, and testing hardware and software for our satellite-based cellular towers in a rapid and agile manner, basically working at a cellular network test engineer. You will work closely with the development team and the product manager to understand the product requirements and provide feedback. You will then be responsible for designing end-to-end test plans, procedures, and scripts for verifying system requirements are met and identifying bugs. Some of your duties will involve...

Perform manual testing when automation doesn’t yet exist (e.g. new features) and automated testing using our automated testing frameworks.
Design and implement automated test cases using languages such as Python, ROBOT, etc..
Contribute to test automation frameworks and data analysis tools.
Leverage various tools and methods, such as network analyzers, traffic generators, simulators, emulators, etc..
Stay updated with the latest cellular network trends and technologies, such as 5G, LTE, and IoT.

Qualifications
• Bachelor’s degree (or higher) in Electrical/Computer Engineering, Software Engineering, Computer Science, Telecommunications Engineering, or a related field.
• At least four years of experience integrating and testing cellular communications systems including (GSM / 2G and LTE / 4G).
• In-depth understanding of the GSM and/or LTE architecture, protocols, and standards.
• Experience using network testing tools and frameworks, such as QXDM, Wireshark, Spirent, IXIA, iPerf, Traceroute, etc.
• Experience writing automated scripts for executing and running telecommunications test cases.
• Proficiency with Linux Operating Systems.
• Proficiency with scripting in Python and Bash.
• Proven experience leading product testing.
• Understanding of networking concepts (Ethernet, TCP/IP, etc.).
• Proficiency desired in Object Oriented Programming (OOP), C/C++, or Java.
• Experience with programming languages, databases, and web technologies, such as C, Python, SQL, and HTML.
• Familiarity with concepts such as DevOps, IaC, CICD, and SCM.Experience with tools such as Gitlab, Jenkins, AWS Cloud, Terraform, Ansible, Docker, and Kubernetes.
• Why is This a Great Opportunity

This is a new client. It's a startup of 56 people with unique technology that allows anyone with a cell phone in any part of the world to text message. Salary ranges have not been set so I entered $0. Salary ranges will be determined through the interview process. My guess is we should first check out local people. VA should be very rich in telecommunications people. We are looking for engineers who have designed products for the cellular networks, 5G, etc.

Private Notes to MembersComments

The internal TA individual provided the following question to help determine a qualified candidate …

In fact, this is the big qualifying question, ""Have you built test automation frameworks from scratch either in Python or another backend language?""
If yes, follow up question, ""were you using a tool to do it, or actually coding in that backend language and building the framework from scratch?""
If they say from scratch, the last follow-up question, ""what were the purposes of several of the test automation frameworks you built?"" (then please jot down what they say here and share with me.)

That's the core role of this engineer. If they are just writing test cases and automating tests, they would not be a fit for this developer position.

There is no salary range for this position and they do not want salary to be posted. The internal recruiter will tell them about the opportunity first.

You will continue to help the team release early and often. We deploy at least once a day. Frequently more often than that.

You will understand our users. Everyone at BackerKit is customer-facing, and we expect everyone to get to know the project creators we are serving (plus, they are awesome, just like you!).

You have the ability to ""look around corners"", allowing you to get out in front of problems.

Our Mission:

We're securing America’s food supply by building the AI farmer that automates our nation’s farms. Our mission is to help farmers farm more profitably and sustainably than ever before.

What We Do:

We start by collecting the most valuable data for farmers, telling them everything about what is growing on their millions of trees, across thousands of acres of farmland. We do this using advanced camera systems we build, that take pictures of every one of the billions of fruit in a farm. This data lives in our cloud data platform, FruitScope, that we've developed from the ground up to help farmers manage their crops with precision.

Farmers across the nation use our industry-leading software to look at their data, make critical decisions, and command farming operations on a daily basis. Our technology is used today across some of the largest farms in the nation.

The Role:

In order to analyze billions of fruit on farms all year long, our advanced, tractor-mounted camera systems have to know a.) precisely where they are, and b.) everything about the fruit they are seeing.

We are looking for a Software Engineer (ML Infra) to build creative, practical, and robust solutions to ML/CV software and infrastructure problems, relating to training edge ML models on massive amounts of real-world farm image data collected by our camera systems.

About the role:
• As an early engineer, you'll receive generous equity compensation
• Full-time role at our San Francisco, CA office
• Flexible working hours
• Comprehensive Health, Vision, and Dental coverage, and we cover 100% of the premium
• We move fast, and sometimes this means staying late or working weekends
• Our team is close-knit & highly driven, you’ll work directly with our CEO and entire team
• We’re deeply motivated by the impact we’re making – every line of code written or new system built means less food that goes to waste, and more people who are fed.

What you’ll do:
• Build and maintain scalable ETL pipelines for processing large, diverse image datasets collected from our tractor-mounted camera systems in farms.
• Stay up-to-date with current literature in computer vision models and architectures, and apply relevant advancements to our systems.
• Develop, deploy, and monitor infrastructure for model training, evaluation, and inference, both in the cloud and on edge devices.
• Design and implement intelligent active sampling infrastructure to optimize data collection and improve model performance.
• Collaborate with a multidisciplinary team to integrate ML solutions into production robotics systems.
• Work closely with agronomists and farmers to understand crop biology and translate domain knowledge into actionable ML features.
• Be a generalist, supporting different parts of our software stack as needed.

What makes you a good fit:
• 3-5+ years of experience building production-grade data pipelines and ML infrastructure.
• Proficiency in Python and experience with ML frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).
• Strong experience with data engineering tools (e.g., Pandas, SQL, Apache Airflow, Spark).
• Familiarity with cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, or Azure) and containerization (Docker, Kubernetes).
• Experience working with massive amounts of real-world training data.
• Familiarity with MLops software and data engineering to ensure consistent deployment of ML models.
• Ability to work independently, learn quickly, and operate in a dynamic environment
• Enthusiasm for taking on multiple roles and responsibilities as our company grows.

Bonus Points:
