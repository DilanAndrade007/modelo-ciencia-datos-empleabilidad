Support the transition to parametric estimating models in later project phases.
Estimate across different geographical locations within the USA, accounting for regional cost variations.
Identify and quantify all direct and indirect costs, including site work, building systems, and finishes.
Perform value engineering to help clients meet budget goals without compromising quality.
Maintain and update cost databases using historical pricing and industry benchmarks.
Review subcontractor and supplier bids, analyze proposals, and identify discrepancies.
Monitor construction costs throughout the project lifecycle to ensure budget adherence.
Provide regular updates on cost status, risks, and financial forecasts.
Collaborate with project managers, architects, engineers, and subcontractors to align scope and cost.
Prepare and deliver cost analysis reports and presentations to clients and senior stakeholders.
Maintain detailed documentation for estimates, change orders, and audit compliance.
Stay informed on industry trends, economic factors, and regulatory changes.
SOX control responsibilities may be part of this role, which are to be adhered to where applicable. 

Qualifications

Bachelor’s degree in Construction Management, Engineering, Architecture, or a related field.
Minimum of 7 years’ experience in cost estimating within retail, commercial, or institutional construction.
